I'm a big believer in community, especially local communities. While I appreciate the way the internet lets us communicate with anyone, anywhere, there is something truly special about being able to walk or hop on my bike and have a conversation in a park or on someone's front porch.

To that end, I have started a social network for Lincoln, Nebraska, in collaboration with [Brent Wilson](https://lincolnite.com/). 

[Lincolnite.net](https://lincolnite.net) is a mastodon powered social media site for residents of Lincoln, Nebraska. I currently run this but am looking for collaborators. You can find me at [@nirak@lincolnite.net](https://lincolnite.net/@nirak)

More on this soon!
