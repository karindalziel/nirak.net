A good dataset is one that can be reused. It is well recognised that this is the case for scientific data, but it's also true for humanities data. During my time at the Center for Digital Research int he Humanities, I have helped regularize our datasets so that they can be programmatically accessed to populate our own or other API's, reformatted into depositable metadata formats, or reused. You can read about my vision for how this reusable data architecture fits into our overall data framework in ["# A new way to publish: The CDRH API"](https://cdrhdev.unl.edu/log/2018/api/). 

I have attended conferences and presented on these topics, and I hope to do more in this area in the future.
