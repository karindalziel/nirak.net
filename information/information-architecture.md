I absolutely love taking a messy dataset and cleaning it up, or helping to categorize information for findability, including website navigation organization and terminology. 

- I have worked on the information architecture for all the sites I have [designed](design/portfolio). 
- I did extensive data cleanup for the site [Nebraska Authors](http://nebraskaauthors.org), cleaning up a free text database with thousands of entries, normalizing dates and categorization and directing the creation of the site search. 
- I have consulted on TEI metadata for many of the projects at the [Center for digital Research in the Humanities](http://cdrh.unl.edu), working with our Metadata Specialist to make changes when needed to better fit overall site architecture.
